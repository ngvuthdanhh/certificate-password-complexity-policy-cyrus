# Lab 4 – Usability vs Security

## Objective
Measure the impact of strict password complexity on user behavior.

## Steps
1. Enforce a very strict policy:
   - Length ≥ 16
   - Must include 4 character types
   - Must not reuse any of last 10 passwords
2. Observe user response:
   - Do users create compliant passwords?
   - Do they reuse patterns?
   - Do they store them insecurely?

## Expected Outcome
- Users may struggle and resort to insecure storage methods.
- Emphasizes the need for password managers and 2FA.

## Reflection
Security must not come at the cost of usability. Policies should encourage strong habits, not create frustration.
