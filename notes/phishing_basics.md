# Phishing Basics

Phishing is a social engineering attack where attackers impersonate trusted entities to trick victims.  
Emails are the most common vector due to their global usage and ease of spoofing.

**Common Characteristics:**
- Fake sender address (email spoofing).
- Urgent call-to-action (e.g., "Your account will be closed").
- Malicious links or attachments.
- Impersonation of well-known organizations.

**Example:**
