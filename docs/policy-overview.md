# Password Complexity Policy — Overview

## 🎯 Objectives
- Ensure passwords are strong enough to resist brute-force and dictionary attacks.  
- Establish a consistent security baseline across the organization.  
- Balance security requirements with usability for end users.

## 🔑 Why Strong Passwords Matter
- Act as the first line of defense against unauthorized access.  
- Reduce the risk of credential stuffing using leaked password databases.  
- Prevent attackers from escalating privileges by exploiting weak accounts.

## 🌍 Standards Comparison
- **NIST SP 800-63B**: Minimum 8 characters (recommended ≥12), no strict requirement for symbols but disallow common/compromised passwords.  
- **ISO 27001 A.9.4.3**: Passwords should be complex and periodically reviewed.  
- **PCI-DSS**: Requires at least 7 characters, must include both numbers and letters.  
- **CIS Benchmarks**: Often recommends ≥14 characters and enforcing MFA alongside password rules.
